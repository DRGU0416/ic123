## Q&A on Community Grants Program

1. With regards to the Accelerate KPI for engagement rate of 250K views for video, is this for one video or ten videos and for how long a period (how many months)?
2. KPI seems high and how are the KPIs being determined?
3. Can you give examples of an Influencer/Youtuber who has made these KPIs?
4. Can the grant application be written in Chinese? All the application forms are in English only.
5. A lot of information is to be filled in during the submission but applicants are not sure if they have filled in correctly especially for non-English speaking applicants.
6. Application process is too complicated especially for non-English speaking applicants.
7. What’s the plan to foster growth for the existing community that has contributed in the past and would like to continue but the criteria have changed and it has become difficult to apply based on V2.
8. How many V2 grants have been approved so far?
9. What are the ratios of approved grants in each region?
10. Who are the 5 reviewers/grant committee members (should there at least be one from Asia)?
11. It is a challenge for Asia/Chinese applicants to articulate their projects when none of the grant review committee are from Asia/China team.
12. What if the content is produced before submitting the grant application?
13. What’s the maximum duration of a grant? Can it be longer than half a year?
14. Can Asia team be part of the grants committee?
15. Why India meetup’s application was rejected based on regional factors?
16. Can IqraCrypto be the candidate to run ICP in Dubai instead of CryptoOasis?
